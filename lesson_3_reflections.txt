When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you're collaborating with someone else or for backup purposes.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because you might make a big change over the course of several commits.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one
instead of another?
Clones are complete copies of a branch of a repository. Forks are clones within GitHub.
Branches are typically used for bigger changes, e.g. an experimental feature. Clones
might be used for collaborating. Forks can be used to make a copy of someone else's work
so you can make your own changes to it.
